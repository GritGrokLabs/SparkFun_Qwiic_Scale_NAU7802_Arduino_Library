  Use the Qwiic Scale to read load cells and scales

  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this 
  and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  The Qwiic Scale is an I2C device that converts analog signals to a 24-bit
  digital signal. This makes it possible to create your own digital scale
  either by hacking an off-the-shelf bathroom scale or by creating your
  own scale using a load cell.
